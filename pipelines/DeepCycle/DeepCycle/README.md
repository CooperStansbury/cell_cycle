# DeepCycle Outputs

Artifacts generated by running DeepCycle. The directory is created by `run_deepcycle.sh` and captures both intermediate files and final model checkpoints for later inspection.

- `input_data.npz` – processed inputs used for training.
- `umap_cell_cycle_theta.svg` – UMAP colored by cell‑cycle angle.
- `fits/` – per‑gene sine‑curve fits.
- `hotelling/` – Hotelling's T² gene‑selection results.
- `training/` – training diagnostics.
- `model/` – saved TensorFlow model.
