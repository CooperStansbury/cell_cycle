## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` – exploratory Jupyter notebooks and utility modules.
- `pipelines/` – reproducible workflows such as Velocyto, DeepCycle, and single‑cell processing pipelines.
- `resources/` – reference data sets and curated gene lists.
- `figures/` – generated figures for reports and manuscripts.

Each subdirectory includes a README describing its contents.
